## Canceled

### Semantic Web Journal

SWJ categories. For all categories there are [specific guidelines](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors) in particular regarding review criteria:
- original research: full paper
- comprehensive overview of state of the art: survey
- description of a (usually, RDF) dataset): dataset description
- description of an ontology: ontology paper
- description of an application with third party use: application report
- description of a deployed tool/system with third party use: tool/systems report

I contacted SWJ editors at contact@semantic-web-journal.net:
- Could you please take a quick look and tell me whether it's worth submitting to SWJ, and in which category? I think the best fit is "Ontologies", although it doesn't describe a new ontology but the vagaries of mapping to an existing family of ontologies (FIBO). If not, I'll completely understand and seek a semantic fintech workshop or similar. If you think it has a chance, I'll format it properly according to submission guidelines.
- Answer: Tricky. We take our submission categories very seriously, i.e. it would have to be rewritten to really fit one. So the main question is: what's the contribution? Skimming what you linked, it's not clear to me where this would fall. You'd certainly have to rewrite it in one direction or the other.
- Thanks for the prompt reply! I'll look for another venue.

## EDBT/ICDT
These are nice conferences that run 2-3 rounds of submissions and are prepared 2y in advance. But it's not a good fit for my paper
- https://dastlab.github.io/edbticdt2024/?contents=EDBT_CFP.html Extending Database Technology
- https://dastlab.github.io/edbticdt2024/?contents=ICDT_CFP.html Database Theory

## Asked

### Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge 

- This journal will start in the fall of 2023
- https://tgdk.org/cfp.html
- Applications of Graph Data & Knowledge: ... finance

tgdk@googlegroups.com, 2023-09-20
Could you please take a quick look at
https://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/crunchbase-fibo/main/README.html
And tell me whether it's appropriate to submit to Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge (TGDK) when you start accepting submissions?
It's about the vagaries of mapping a large real-world dataset (Crunchbase) to an extensive family of ontologies (FIBO).
"Finance" is listed as one of TGDK's application areas.

Aidan Hogan <aidhog@gmail.com>:
The work looks very interesting, and thank you for your interest in TGDK! Indeed we are now in the process of opening up to submissions, 
and your paper is clearly in scope in terms of area, 
but in revising your work, we are not sure that it meets the requirements as a Research Paper
(with proofs, experiments, etc., to generate new knowledge). 
So it might not be suited to TGDK at the moment.
However, the work could be potentially very interesting for the 
Resources or In-Use Track of a conference like ESWC or ISWC, 
or indeed the Semantic Web Journal has some submissions types (tools, systems, etc.) that might better fit with this work. 
It would still of course be important to revise the respective criteria of the venue and maybe chat with the corresponding editors/chairs.

Vladimir: 
Thanks for the response! It's indeed not a Research Paper, so I think it's better to look for another venue.
I asked at SWJ previously, and Pascal Hitzler rightly said "We take our submission categories very seriously"...
- Thanks for the suggestion about ISWC/ESWC "in use"! Submission for those will be in March.
- International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data has an appropriate topic, but it's in China...
- I'm looking at some banking/accounting journals, because some FIBO papers were published there.
- Also, WWW may have an appropriate workshop, this will be seen in November.

Could you please take a quick look at https://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/crunchbase-fibo/main/README.html
and tell me whether it's appropriate to submit to the Journal of Banking Regulation?
It's about the vagaries of mapping a large real-world dataset (Crunchbase) to an extensive family of ontologies (FIBO).
The topic is semantic web and the paper is rather technical, but one of the original FIBO papers was published in your journal:
Bennett, Mike. The financial industry business ontology: Best practice for big data. Journal of Banking Regulation 14.3-4: 255-268. 2013
